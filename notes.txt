Goal: Build a Black-Scholes Options trading model.

Stage 1: 
	
    Return 5 main inputs to an option's price
		Volatility, 
		stock price, 
		strike price, 
		time to expiry, 
		interest rate
	
	Then spits out call and put value
	All values are entered by the user

Stage 2: 

	Adjustments:
		Fixed critical error: sigma was not min-max normalized
	
	Upgrades:
		Added rate.py, which fetches data to automatically insert risk-free rate. Might change later since most B-S online calculators
		explicitely ask for.

Stage 3:

	Upgrades: will calculate and display greeks for call and put
